Meaning of this is :
"Know that by which all this is known" means understanding the source or system
that makes knowledge possible â€” not just knowing things, but understanding how we know them.

Relation to Software Engineering:

It does relate. Writing code is only one aspect of software engineering;
we also need to comprehend the concepts, resources, and abstractions that underlie it,
such as design patterns and architecture. This indicates a higher degree of comprehension,
such as being aware of the system that supports all other systems.
